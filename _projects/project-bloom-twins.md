Bloom Twins - RPGMaker Demo
===========================

Bloom Twins is a small RPGMaker game demo made over the course of several weeks for a University Unit in which we focused on and made use of the Agile methodology.

For the project we decided upon making a small slice of a possible game which would cover an intro and a questing system. The public repo of mine and my teams contribution can be found here: [RPGMaker Game Repo](https://github.com/Chi-Time/DAC515-RPGMaker-Game/tree/dev)

My role in this project was split amongst many areas as I found myself helping various people out with their tasks across various areas but my main role was that of being the implementation team lead as well as Scrum Master for the Implementation team. During my time on these duties I developed as part of my role several pieces of admin documentation and helped organise the team's design document and implement several back-end systems such as UI's, Loot systems, Questing systems etc. 

Over the course of the project, the design team had many setbacks and I would often in my spare time go and help them out with design tasks and eventually found myself developing a good portion of the intro quest and dialogue with another designer who needed help. I also served as adviser to the design team and helped them with documentation and skill tables. 

Along with this, I found myself with a lot of free time during the later portions of the project when development slowed and so I spent it by creating the musical score for the demo for the town's theme, dungeon theme and boss theme.

The project was a great experience and I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot about team work in a current development methodology. I also gained a greater insight into the development process of a game and helped hone my skills in quest development, level design, scripting and developing in another engine.
