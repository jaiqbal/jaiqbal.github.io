Subway Level Design
===================

A prototype level design made in Unity for a digital prototyping unit at Southampton Solent University with the premise of the game being that of a 3rd person cover based shooter.

The level design was sketched and it's flow made beforehand on paper and then mocked up in UE4 before being finally made in Unity using pro-builder with imported prototype assets.
