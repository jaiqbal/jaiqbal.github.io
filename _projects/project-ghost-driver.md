Ghost Driver
==============================

## A fully developed small demo of a game

A small game demo in which I was the primary developer of the game's systems and art style as well as serving as producer and narrative/mechanic design. I helped design the UI menu's along with the game's mode splitting from a first person exploration to puzzle game for each sub-area.

Check out the game below:
