The Curious Case of the Cabbage - Oblivion Mod
==============================================

The Curious Case of the Cabbage is an Oblivion mod made over the course of several weeks for a University unit in which we focused on and made use of the Waterfall development methodology.
For the project, my team and I decided on making up a small questline which would allow for multiple ending choices from the player at any point and provide dialogue options and quest endings based on the player's actions of how they chose to end it.

The repo of my development contribution can be found here: [Oblivion Mod Repo](https://github.com/Chi-Time/DAC515-Oblivion-Mod/tree/dev) 

The mod itself can be downloaded and played from here: [Nexus Mods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/49348)

During the course of development I worked closely with Martynas in helping out with the design of the mod in which I helped create the story alongside him. My main role and job during the project was to implement the design doc elements into the mod itself. When it came to the dungeon I was handed a design from Martynas which it was then my job to add aesthetic and environmental narrative to the dungeon as well as place the locations of quest items.
